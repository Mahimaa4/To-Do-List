# To-Do-List
A simple, responsive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
My initial dive into web development! This To-Do List project was created to practice and solidify my understanding of HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling user interfaces, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and managing the Document Object Model (DOM).
